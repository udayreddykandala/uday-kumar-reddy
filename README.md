👋 Hi, I’m Uday Kumar Reddy Kandala

🚀 Full-Stack Developer | Cloud Enthusiast | AI Explorer

I love building real-world web apps that solve everyday problems — from job tracking systems integrated with Google Drive & Sheets, to Leave Management Systems and personal productivity tools. My focus is on creating clean, responsive UIs with React, and powering them with secure, scalable backends in Python/Flask or Node. .

Frontend: React, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind

Backend: Python (Flask, Django), Node.js (Express), REST APIs

Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

Cloud & DevOps: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Docker, CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)

Other: OAuth 2.0, JWT, Git, Agile workflows
